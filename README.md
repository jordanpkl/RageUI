I would like to make an announcement about the official partners of my projects.

Today, I offer you the possibility to buy different virtual servers (VPS) LXC or KVM (Linux or Windows) via PrivateHeberg.net.

The perfect solution for the conception / realisation of your projects.

Let me point out that Privateheberg uses professional protection against DDOS attacks (VAC TILERA) in addition to the private protection provided by PrivateHeberg.

A discount code of 8% is valid on all products on the site for a period of 3 months. (valid for renewals) 

### PrivateHeberg is not a waste hosting company, it does not use a shitty technology like WHMCS or WorldPress. 

I personally recommend NvME products (LXC / KVM)

Discount code : <code>PACO</code> (-8%)
 
# RageUI

RageUI is the official replacement for NativeUI-Reloaded. This library allows you to create menus in GTA:O style. This project is open-source, so we rely on the community to help us upgrade/update RageUI. You can also work with us on the project to try to patch some issues.

We invite you to respect the hard work that comes with providing this great and useful menu library!
